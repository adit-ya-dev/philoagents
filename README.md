# PhiloAgents

**AI-powered game simulation engine to impersonate popular philosophers.**

## 📖 About This Project

An AI-powered simulation engine that brings historical philosophers to life in an interactive environment. Have deep conversations with Plato, debate ethics with Aristotle, or discuss artificial intelligence with Turing himself!

### 🎮 Features

- **AI Character Simulation**: Dynamic AI personalities that authentically embody historical philosophers
- **Production-Ready RAG Systems**: Vector database integration with knowledge from Wikipedia and Stanford Encyclopedia
- **Real-time API**: RESTful API with FastAPI and WebSocket support
- **Advanced Agent Features**: Short and long-term memory using MongoDB
- **Modern Architecture**: End-to-end system design with monitoring and observability

## 🎯 What's Inside

**Intelligent Agent System:**
- Agent development and orchestration with LangGraph
- RAG agentic communication patterns
- Character impersonation through prompt engineering

**Production Architecture:**
